           <p>Quentin Tarantino has filed court papers to state that he is owed over $4m in royalties from the Weinstein Company.</p>
           <p>The failed film company is currently taking bids for its assets yet before any sale is made, the film-maker has posted an objection along with a host of other big names, including Jennifer Lawrence and Jake Gyllenhaal.
           After six months of </p>
           <p>According to the Hollywood Reporter, the director’s lawyer has filed papers referring to “numerous uncured monetary and non-monetary defaults” that he is owed before any sale is made. He is seeking $300,000 for Grindhouse, $575,000 for Inglourious Basterds, $1.25m for Django Unchained and nearly $2.5m for The Hateful Eight.</p>
           <p>Tarantino’s long-running friendship with Harvey Weinstein was put under the spotlight after the producer was accused of sexual assault and harassment by a long list of women in the past year. “I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard,” he told the New York Times in October last year. “If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him.”</p>
           <p>The film-maker cut ties with Weinstein and moved his next project, the ensemble drama Once Upon a Time in Hollywood starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, to Sony.</p>
           <p>Other stars have also involved their lawyers in the fight for royalties including Gyllenhaal, who is after money from his boxing drama Southpaw alongside co-star Rachel McAdams, as well as Julia Roberts and Meryl Streep for August Osage County.</p>
           <p>According to Deadline, an unidentified New York-based bidder is putting together an offer that would see the Weinstein Company remain an active studio as well as provide compensation for the women who claim that Weinstein sexually harassed or assaulted them.</p>

            <h1>Quentin Tarantino apologizes for Polanski defense: 'I was ignorant'</h1>

            <p>Quentin Tarantino has apologized for remarks he made about Roman Polanski’s sexual assault of Samantha Geimer.</p>
            <p>In a resurfaced interview with Howard Stern, he defined the incident as “not rape” because he believed the 13-year-old wanted to have sex with the film-maker.In a statement, issued to Indiewire, Tarantino has apologized for what he now calls “ignorant” beliefs.</p>
            <p>“I want to publicly apologize to Samantha Geimer for my cavalier remarks on the Howard Stern Show speculating about her and the crime that was committed against her,” he wrote. “Fifteen years later, I realize how wrong I was. Ms Geimer WAS raped by Roman Polanski. When Howard brought up Polanski, I incorrectly played devil’s advocate in the debate for the sake of being provocative. I didn’t take Ms Geimer’s feelings into consideration and for that I am truly sorry. So, Ms Geimer, I was ignorant, and insensitive, and above all, incorrect.”</p>
            <p>The comments follow on from an interview with Geimer earlier this week. “He was wrong,” she said to the New York Daily News. “I bet he knows it … I’m not upset, but I would probably feel better if he realizes now that he was wrong, after 15 years, after hearing the facts.”</p>
            <p>Tarantino is set to start production on his untitled next film, set around the backdrop of the Charles Manson murders with Polanski as a character in the story. His wife Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson family in 1969.</p>
            <p>The tape of Tarantino’s interview was brought to light after the director was accused of negligence by Uma Thurman on the set of Kill Bill. In an interview with the New York Times, the actor recalled unsafe working conditions that resulted in a car accident.</p>
            <p>“I am guilty, for putting her in that car, but not the way that people are saying I am guilty of it,” he has since said. “It was just driving. None of us looked at it as a stunt. Maybe we should have, but we didn’t. I’m sure when it was brought up to me, that I rolled my eyes and was irritated. But I’m sure I wasn’t in a rage and I wasn’t livid.”</p>
            <p>News of the incident, supported by video footage released by Thurman, has led to outrage in the stunt community. “The stuff that went on is appalling,” veteran stunt performer and coordinator Andy Armstrong told the Hollywood Reporter. “That could have been a death by decapitation. The car could easily have rolled over [or] the camera could have flown forward. It was irresponsibility on a mega level.”</p>

            <h1>Quentin Tarantino remembers Reservoir Dogs: 'I counted the walkouts'</h1>
            <p>Sat 29 Apr 2017</p>

            <p>When Reservoir Dogs hit theaters in 1992, it rocketed a young film-maker from obscurity and reinvented independent film. On Friday night, to mark the 25th anniversary of Quentin Tarantino’s gritty, violent and groundbreaking tale of crime and betrayal, the director and cast members Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel reunited for a screening at the Tribeca Film Festival.</p>
            <p>“There are so many things about this movie where I didn’t know anything,” Tarantino said, onstage at the Beacon Theatre in New York. “If I could do it all again, I’d do it slightly differently.”</p>
            <p>The screening was a jewel of this year’s Tribeca lineup. In contrast, Tarantino said of the film’s premiere at Sundance in 1992, “the first time we screened it was a disaster.</p>
            <p>“It was our very first public screening. They didn’t have a scope lens for the projector and it’s a scope movie and I let them show it anyway. That would have been bad enough.”</p>
            <p>The problems only escalated from there, he said. “It gets to the final climax and all of the sudden the lights come up. They go back down, and then almost as if on purpose as far as suspense is concerned, right at the height of the movie there’s a power outage and all the power goes out.</p>
            <p>“It was great because [at the time] I had barely left Los Angeles county, let alone visiting other continents. The thing is, at a film festival screening sometimes people don’t know what they’re about to see. They read the program and hear a synopsis and that’s it, so it’s understandable that at a film festival that maybe this is not what they want to see and they have to leave.</p>
            <p>Perceptions quickly shifted, the movie becoming a breakout hit at Sundance, being picked up for distribution by Miramax and quickly growing into a genuine cult hit. It also attracted its fair share of controversy thanks to its brutal violence. Until 1995, the film was barred from release on home video in the UK.</p>

                <h1>Tarantino's controversial Manson film casts Brad Pitt alongside Leonardo DiCaprio</h1>
                <p>Thu 1 Mar 2018</p>

                <p>Brad Pitt is to join Leonardo DiCaprio as one of the lead actors in Quentin Tarantino’s forthcoming movie about the murders perpetrated by Charles Manson and his “family” in 1969.</p>
                <p>According to Deadline, DiCaprio and Pitt will play Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth, a former TV star and his stunt double who are living in Los Angeles in 1969. In a statement released by Sony Pictures, Tarantino describes his film as “a story that takes place in Los Angeles in 1969, at the height of hippy Hollywood … Both [men] are struggling to make it in a Hollywood they don’t recognise any more. But Rick has a very famous next door neighbour … Sharon Tate.”</p>
                <p>Tarantino has also announced the film’s title, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and the release date has been set as 9 August, 2019, on the 50th anniversary of the murders, in which the heavily pregnant Tate, then married to Roman Polanski, along with three friends and a visitor to the house’s caretaker, were killed by Manson acolytes Charles “Tex” Watson, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel. Margot Robbie has been courted to play the role of Tate, but her casting has not been confirmed.</p>
                <p>Tarantino added: “I’ve been working on this script for five years, as well as living in Los Angeles County most of my life, including in 1969, when I was seven years old. I’m very excited to tell this story of an LA and a Hollywood that don’t exist any more.”</p>
                <p>However, the project has attracted considerable controversy, in the wake of a series of allegations about Tarantino’s behaviour. In February,  that he had spat on her during the shooting of Kill Bill, and that she had been forced to undertake a driving stunt that left her injured. A 2003 interview with Howard Stern re-emerged shortly afterwards, in which Tarantino defended Roman Polanski over the latter’s 1977 rape charges (which were subsequently downgraded after a plea deal to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor). Tarantino’s longtime working relationship with disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein has also come under the spotlight, with in October last year, saying: “I knew enough to do more than I did.”</p>

                <h1>Pulp science-fiction? How Quentin Tarantino could save Star Trek</h1>
                <p>Wed 6 Dec 2017</p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="../QTimages/News/news4.jpg" alt="">
                </figure>
                <p>If you were to draw up a shortlist of likely directors for the next Star Trek movie, auteurish cinephile, renowned grump and all-round cuss-enthusiast Quentin Tarantino would probably not be on it. And yet we may be plotting a course towards exactly that. QT has pitched a Trek idea to producer JJ Abrams, who is so impressed that he’s going to assemble a writers’ room to hammer it out. Tarantino could feasibly direct.</p>
                <p>Yes, it sounds like spinning-bowtie, box-of-frogs madness: a cray-cray cross-pollination of eye-watering obscenity and Prime Directive piousness. But imagine Tarantino boldly going where no one has gone before. It could crash and burn like the USS Vengeance. Or – and try to seriously picture it for a second – it could be utterly fantastic.</p>
                <p>It’s definitely the right time for the franchise to offer up a WTF like this. The last movie, Star Trek Beyond, felt like a film that didn’t quite quite know what to do with itself. It was the third in the rehatched series but not a trilogy-closing culmination. It felt like a placeholder, an extended big-budget TV episode that left its characters much in the same way it had found them. There were no real stakes, no sense of finality.</p>
                <p>With a new Star Wars movie seemingly every six weeks,  and a Trek TV series currently sating Trekkies’ appetites, clamour for big-screen Enterprise outings has waned. Put simply, Trek needs a sharp kick up the backside. And it’s hard to think of a more steel-toecapped wallop in the fundament than one administered by Tarantino.</p>
                <p>It’s not as weird a fit as it sounds, either. Tarantino has shown he’s got the action chops a tentpole like this requires. Both of Kill Bill’s volumes are stuffed with some of the finest and most creative duff-em-up sequences of the last two decades, while Django Unchained and  were no slouches when called on for action. He’s never done squillion-dollar CGI spectacle, but neither had Taika Waititi until he made . It seems to be something you can learn. Tarantino might have to tone down the claret-drenched ultraviolence a tad to ensure that all-important 12A rating, but he could probably manage that if he tried really, really hard.</p>
                <p>It’s not action competence that makes Tarantino such an intriguing Trek proposition, though. Previous Treks each had a fine actor as the primary antagonists – Eric Bana, Idris Elba, Bendleworth Crumbleflatch – but none will go down as an all-time great baddies. Something was missing: for all they menaced, there was little actual menace.</p>
                <p>Tarantino is the man who made the lovely Christoph Waltz a beast of clammy nightmares; who turned Michael Madsen into a Pavlovian trigger for the flopsweats; who, in Django Unchained, imbued Leo DiCaprio with so much malice people now cheer when he freezes to death in Titanic. A 12A certificate is no barrier to this: look at Heath Ledger’s Joker. Star Trek needs a good, three-dimensional baddie. Tarantino can deliver in spades.</p>
                <p>More importantly, though, Trek is an examination of friendship, shining most vibrantly when Kirk, Spock and Bones are bickering and riffing off each other. This is where Tarantino makes the most sense. Even if he doesn’t write all the dialogue himself, you know any chat-heavy sequences will be snappy, bouncy and assuredly naturalistic. New Trek has strived for this before, and has achieved it on occasion. Tarantino would knock it out of the park.</p>
                <p>He can do action. He can do shocks. He can do dialogue. He can do suspense. He could provide a shot of adrenaline to the heart of this directionless franchise. It’ll probably never happen. This is likely all Hollywood hearsay and fanboy what-ifery. The odds of a studio giving Tarantino final edit of an action epic, or the chances of him agreeing to do the movie without it, are slim indeed. But … maybe. Just maybe</p>
                <p>If the sharp-chinned one sticks to his word to retire after 10 movies, this, after the Manson murders movie he’s currently got in development, would make his Trek the final film of his career. What a typically unexpected, Tarantino-esque way to go out.</p>
